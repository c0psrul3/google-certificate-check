In order to build this, you'll need:

  * Unbound: http://www.unbound.net/download.html.

  * OpenSSL: http://openssl.org/source/.

If you see anything weird, please send me the command line and
certificate chain (i.e. all the text in:

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.
.
.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

There may be multiple certificates, send them all. Don't forget I need
the host name!
